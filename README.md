## Can I predict if customers will buy travel insurance? 

These data were acquired from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data)
***
### Project Description
This notebook uses the 
[Travel Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tejashvi14/travel-insurance-prediction-data) to generate 
hypotheses tests and supervised machine learning models (i.e. classification models) in order to predict whether a 
customer will purchase travel insurance and to better understand customers who do and do not purchase travel insurance. 

Goals:
- Perform data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Plot the data informatively
- Create various statistical and machine learning models to better understand the dataset 
- optimize the classification model 
- Test the optimized classification model

Altogether, these aims should allow us to predict whether someone is likely to purchase travel insurance given our 
model and to better understand the relationships between the features in these data and purchasing travel insurance.
